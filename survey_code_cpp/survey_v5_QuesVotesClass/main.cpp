/* 
 * File:    main.cpp
 * Author:  Danielle F
 * Created: 04-13-23 @8PM
 * Purpose:  survey project v4
 * 
 * v1:
 * Admin inherits User
 * Added admin readBin(), wrtAdminTxt() & wrtAdminBin()
 * Fixed bug: Admin is crashing. Added a cout inside ~Admin().
 * Added 3 constructors for User. 
 * Added recSize & begnFile variables to Admin so it could  
 * hold their info when handling a binary record.
 * Admin can rewrite the value for hiScore in userData.dat when 
 * it uses findByEmail() to set records size & beginning file location.
 * Admin can rewrite one full binary record instead of just hiScoore.
 * Copied this folder to yahtzee_v15
 * Added getMenu() so I can focus on my survey.
 *  Rewrites 1 record in usrdata.txt after it rewrites binary.
 * 
 * 
 v2:
 * I copied my Admin & User classes from yahtzee_v21 to here.
 * Created string array with 1 question and 3 possible answers.
 * Created a loop to mimic 5 people answering this 1 question
 * Created counters for each question's possible answer and
   reassigned int votes[] with the the counters some answered the question.
 * Passed the questions and answers arrays to a print function.
 * Created prntChart() that displays the voting results as well as a histogram 
   with stars to represent each vote.
 * 
 * 
 v3: 
 * Moved qusAns[] and votes[] to a structure in main(). It won't work in Question.h
 * Created 1 instance of Question structure and made sure it still ran correctly.
 * Changed prntChart() to accept a structure instead of 2 difference types of arrays
 * 
 * 
 v4: 
 * Had to create Survey class and move Questions to it because i skipped a step.
 * In Questions class I made it 4 strings instead of an array of strings.
 * Questions reads its questions and possible answers from a text file.
 * In Questions getSurve() I created an array of questions, prompted User,
   and saved their answers to an instance of Votes.
 * Added Votes structure and aggregated an instance of it in Questions class.
 * In main() menu case 4 allows you to take a survey as a guest and doesn't save
 * its results to any files.
 * 
 * 
 v5:
 * Update this version with store_v1.4's User and Admin Classes.
 * 
 * 
 To Do: 
 
 * Make Survey class create an array of Votes, then write to files. Print chart.
 * 
 * Figure out how to pass Questions array to other functions with its cpp page.
 
 * When User is logged in write Votes array to their record.
 
 * Make getAllUsr() print outside of its function
  
 * Destroy double ptr in Yahtzee class & in Admin class?
 
 * Make readInput() read inputs from file again
 
 * Add a bool variable to Admin as a flag for deleted records?
 
 * DRY. Clean up repetitive code.
