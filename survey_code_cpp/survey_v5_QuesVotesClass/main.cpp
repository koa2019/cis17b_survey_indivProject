/* 
 * File:    main.cpp
 * Author:  Danielle F
 * Created: 04-13-23 @8PM
 * Purpose:  survey project v4
 * 
 * v1:
 * Admin inherits User
 * Added admin readBin_setArray(), wrtAdminTxt() & wrtAdminBin()
 * Fixed bug: Admin is crashing. Added a cout inside ~Admin().
 * Added 3 constructors for User. 
 * Added recSize & begnFile variables to Admin so it could  
 * hold their info when handling a binary record.
 * Admin can rewrite the value for hiScore in userData.dat when 
 * it uses findByEmail() to set records size & beginning file location.
 * Admin can rewrite one full binary record instead of just hiScoore.
 * Copied this folder to yahtzee_v15
 * Added getMenu() so I can focus on my survey.
 *  Rewrites 1 record in usrdata.txt after it rewrites binary.
 * 
 * 
 v2:
 * I copied my Admin & User classes from yahtzee_v21 to here.
 * Created string array with 1 question and 3 possible answers.
 * Created a loop to mimic 5 people answering this 1 question
 * Created counters for each question's possible answer and
   reassigned int votes[] with the the counters some answered the question.
 * Passed the questions and answers arrays to a print function.
 * Created prntChart() that displays the voting results as well as a histogram 
   with stars to represent each vote.
 * 
 * 
 v3: 
 * Moved qusAns[] and votes[] to a structure in main(). It won't work in Question.h
 * Created 1 instance of Question structure and made sure it still ran correctly.
 * Changed prntChart() to accept a structure instead of 2 difference types of arrays
 * 
 * 
 v4: 
 * Had to create Survey class and move Questions to it because i skipped a step.
 * In Questions class I made it 4 strings instead of an array of strings.
 * Questions reads its questions and possible answers from a text file.
 * In Questions getSurve() I created an array of questions, prompted User,
   and saved their answers to an instance of Votes.
 * Added Votes structure and aggregated an instance of it in Questions class.
 * In main() menu case 4 allows you to take a survey as a guest and doesn't save
 * its results to any files.
 * 
 * 
 v5:
 * Update this version with store_v1.4's User and Admin Classes.
 * Moving start() from Question.cpp to Survey.cpp
 * Survey class creates array of Question and aggregates instance
   of Votes, then rewrites hiScore in start().
 * Moved Votes class to User class public members. This way I can access votes
 * functions without writing extra get() in User class.
 * Printed Votes object in User:wrtVotes();  
 * Wrote Votes[] to userData.txt file. Added 14 chars to charCount in reWrtTxt().
 * When User is logged in, Votes array within User is written 
   to binary and read it from binary. correctly. It writes and rewrites to text file.
   You can't loop through votes while reading from binary cause it messes it up.
 * I realized i wasn't setPwrd() inside of readBin_setArray(). idk how it still worked? lol
 * Case 4 in adminPortal() calls editVotes();
 * Inside of editVotes() and delete() I added usrArr[ind]-> to readBin_setArray().
 * 
 * Aggregated Votes QueSums[3] in Admin's variables to represent the total 
 * number of votes each question received.
 * Changed hiScore to voteSiz
 * 
 * 
 To Do: 
 * add all votes for each question to Votes survySums and print histogram;
 * Make readInput() read inputs from file again 
 * Add a bool variable to Admin as a flag for deleted records?
 
 * DRY. Clean up repetitive code.
